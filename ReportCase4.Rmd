# Markov Model Analysis

This script implements a Markov model for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of CBT vs. TAU.


General death probabilities for UHR:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)

death_prob = 0.003 # defined outside define_parameters() because there was a bug
rr = 0.501 # effectiveness of CBT compared to TAU from RCT 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
